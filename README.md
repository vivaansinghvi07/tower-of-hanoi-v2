# Tower of Hanoi Remake!

The goal of this game is to transfer all your blocks from the first tower to the third, with the limitations that you can only move one block at a time and cannot place blocks on 'heavier' ones.

In my previous version, I relied on uncolored, normal characters to display blocks. This time, I implemented ANSI into the mix!

### Features: 
- Can detect if a game was played optimally (in the fewest moves)
- Colored blocks
- Clears screen after each move
- Input checkers (makes sure it is in the right format)
- Smooth text printing
- Lots more!

This game, such as the other one, takes two numbers as input: the origin tower and the recipient tower.
Here is a snippet of a move:
